### Why create a custom HTML page?

Most Jekyll pages in the Chirpy theme use the theme’s built-in layouts and styles.
Sometimes, you may want a **stand-alone page** that:

* Uses **your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** without being wrapped in the theme.
* Looks and behaves completely differently from the rest of your blog.
* Hosts small apps, experiments, or tools (like a calculator, flashcards, or quiz).
* Still tracks visitors using the same GoatCounter analytics as the rest of the site.

For this, we can make a **full HTML page** with `layout: null` and integrate GoatCounter manually.

---

### 1) Create your HTML file

You can store the file **anywhere** that’s **not** in an underscored folder (e.g. `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_posts`).

For example:

```
custom-pages/app-name.html
```

or

```
app-name.html
```

---

### 2) Add the front matter

This tells Jekyll:

* **`layout: null`** → Don’t wrap the page in Chirpy’s layout (we’re writing full HTML ourselves).
* **`permalink:`** → Control the **published URL** (independent of file location).

At the very top of your file:

```markdown
---
title: My Custom App
layout: null
permalink: /app-name/
---
```

Result:
This page will be published at:

```
https://yourdomain.com/app-name/
```

---

### 3) Add GoatCounter includes

GoatCounter needs two parts:

1. **Tracking script** – sends the pageview hit.
2. **Display script** – fetches and shows the count in your page.

---

### 4) Add a simple “XX visitors” block

We’ll make this **non-localized** and style it inline so it doesn’t depend on Chirpy’s CSS.

```html
<div style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <span>
    <em id="pageviews" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; color: #ffffff;">
      Loading…
    </em> visitors
  </span>
</div>
```

---

### 5) Full example page

Here’s a working template you can copy–paste into your file, then replace the placeholder CSS/HTML/JS with your own.

```html
---
title: My Custom App
layout: null
permalink: /webapps/app-name/
---

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
  <meta name="theme-color" content="#6c5ce7" />

  <!-- Your CSS -->
  <style>
    /* Your custom styles here */
  </style>

  <!-- GoatCounter tracking (sends the hit) -->
  {% raw %}
  {% include analytics/goatcounter.html %}
  {% endraw %}
</head>
<body>
  <main class="container">

    <!-- Visitors counter UI -->
    <div style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #111111; margin-top: 1rem;">
      <span>
        <em id="pageviews" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; color: #111111;">
          Loading…
        </em> visitors
      </span>
    </div>

    <!-- Your custom HTML content -->
    {% raw %}
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    {% endraw %}
    <p>This is my custom HTML app.</p>

  </main>

  <!-- Your JavaScript -->
  <script>
    // Your custom JS here
  </script>

  <!-- GoatCounter display (fetches & fills #pageviews) -->
  {% raw %}
  {% include pageviews/goatcounter.html %}
  {% endraw %}
</body>
</html>
```

---

### 6) Make sure GoatCounter is set in `_config.yml`

You already have this, but for completeness:

```yml
pageviews:
  provider: goatcounter

analytics:
  goatcounter:
    id: your-goatcounter-id   # e.g. "linsnotes" for linsnotes.goatcounter.com
```

---

### 7) Test locally

Run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Visit:

```
http://localhost:4000/app-name/
```

You should see:

* “Loading…” in the visitors block.
* After a short delay, it changes to a number from GoatCounter.

💡 **Key takeaway:**
The `permalink` controls your page’s public URL — not the file’s location. You can keep your custom pages neatly organized anywhere in your repo.
