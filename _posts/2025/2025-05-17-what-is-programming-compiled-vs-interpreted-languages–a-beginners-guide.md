# What Is Programming?

## Compiled vs Interpreted Languages – What Beginners Need to Know

So you’ve decided to learn programming — brilliant! But now you’re hearing words like compiler, interpreter, libraries, packages, and maybe even runtime. Feeling overwhelmed?

Don’t worry — we’ll explain everything using something everyone understands: cooking.

---

## Quick Analogy: Programming Is Like Cooking

| Real Life              | Programming            |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| You (the chef)         | You (the programmer)   |
| Recipe in another language | Code (C++, Python, etc.) |
| Robot cooks            | Computer hardware      |
| Translator             | Compiler / Interpreter |
| Spice mixes & sauces   | Libraries / Packages   |

You want your robot cooks (your computer) to follow your recipe (your code), but they only understand machine language (1s and 0s). So you need a translator — either a compiler or an interpreter — to help.

---

## Compiled Languages (e.g. C, C++)

**Analogy**: You translate the entire recipe before cooking starts.

### How It Works
1. You write your recipe in C/C++.
2. A compiler translates the entire code into machine language.
3. Your computer runs the translated version quickly and efficiently.

**C code → compiler → machine code → run**

### Pros
- Very fast after translation
- Can be optimised to run better (e.g. simplify steps, reuse values)

### Cons
- Slower to start — you must compile before running
- Harder to debug — errors show up after full translation

### What You Need to Install
- A compiler (e.g. `g++`)
- Optional libraries (e.g. for graphics, maths, sound)

---

### How to Make a .exe File (C++)

When you compile C++ code using `g++`, it already creates a `.exe` file on Windows:

```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello.exe
```

Double-click the .exe file to run your program without the terminal!

### Want a Basic Graphical Interface (UI)?

Use a library like WinAPI, SFML, or Qt (a bit more advanced):
```bash
#include <windows.h>

int main() {
    MessageBox(0, "Hello!", "Greeting", MB_OK);
    return 0;
}
```

Compile it the same way — and your .exe pops up a window!

---

## Interpreted Languages (e.g. Python)

Analogy: A live translator reads the recipe step-by-step as you cook.

### How It Works
	1.	You write your recipe in Python.
	2.	An interpreter reads and runs each line in real time.

**Python code → interpreter reads line-by-line → runs immediately**

### Pros
- Quick to start and test
- Easy to fix mistakes — interpreter stops exactly where the error happens

### Cons
- Slower performance — it reads as it goes
- Less optimised — it doesn’t improve your code

What You Need to Install
	•	Python interpreter
	•	Packages (e.g. numpy, pandas)
	•	Package managers like pip or conda

---

### How to Make a .exe File (Python)

Python normally runs in the terminal, but you can convert your script to a .exe file using:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile hello.py
```

This creates dist/hello.exe — now your Python script runs like a standalone app!

### Want a Basic Graphical Interface (UI)?

Use the built-in Tkinter module:

```bash
import tkinter as tk

def say_hello():
    name = entry.get()
    label.config(text="Hello, " + name + "!")

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Greeting App")

entry = tk.Entry(root)
entry.pack()

button = tk.Button(root, text="Say Hello", command=say_hello)
button.pack()

label = tk.Label(root)
label.pack()

root.mainloop()

```

Save as hello_gui.py, then convert to .exe:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed hello_gui.py
```

Now you have a basic .exe app with a window interface!

Why It Matters in Machine Learning
	•	Python is the go-to language — easy to write, read, and test ideas.
	•	Behind the scenes, tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch use compiled C++ for performance.
	•	It’s like Python is the friendly head chef, and C++ is the super-fast robot sous chef.

---

### Side-by-Side Comparison

Feature	Compiled Language (C/C++)	Interpreted Language (Python)
Translator	Compiler	Interpreter
When Code Runs	After compiling	While reading each line
Speed	Very fast	Slower
Debugging	Harder — fix after compile	Easier — errors show up live
Beginner-Friendly?	Less — more setup	Yes — quick to try things
Used in ML?	Yes — behind the scenes	Yes — main interface
What to Install	Compiler + Libraries	Interpreter + Packages
Can Make .exe?	Yes — auto from compiler	Yes — using PyInstaller
UI Option	WinAPI, Qt, SFML (advanced)	Tkinter (built-in)


---

Let’s Try a Simple Program: “Hello, {Your Name}”

1. Python (Interpreted Language)

What to install:
	•	Python interpreter
	•	Any text editor (e.g. Notepad or VS Code)

Code:

```bash
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

Run:
```bash
python hello.py
```

Make into .exe:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile hello.py
```

---

2. C++ (Compiled Language)

What to install:
	•	A C++ compiler like g++
	•	A text/code editor

Code:
```bash
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name;
    cout << "What's your name? ";
    cin >> name;
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Compile & run:

```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello.exe
./hello
```
Your .exe is ready to share!

## Final Thought

Knowing whether your language is compiled or interpreted is like knowing whether you’re cooking from scratch or using a meal kit.
	•	Want full control and speed? Compiled languages are great.
	•	Want fast results and simplicity? Interpreted languages like Python are perfect.
	•	Want a real .exe app with buttons? You can do it in both — just pick your tool.

Programming is like cooking — it’s not about having the fanciest kitchen. It’s about learning the basics, experimenting, and making things that work.
