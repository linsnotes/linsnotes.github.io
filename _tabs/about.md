## Hi. I’m Kuibin Lin. Nice to meet you!

I can’t quite recall when or how it started, but at some point, I realised that a basic understanding of programming isn’t just practical—it underpins innovation and progress while helping us navigate and understand the modern world. Back at university, I always wanted to take a programming module, but it never worked out with my schedule. So, I never got to study it formally at university.

After I started working, I took a short course on data science with Python. My learning’s been a bit on and off since then, but my curiosity about programming and computer hardware has never gone away.

With bootcamps and courses being quite pricey, I decided to teach myself using online resources like YouTube, Coursera, and Udemy. When [AI Singapore](https://aisingapore.org/) offered a promotional price for its AI course along with a DataCamp subscription code, I made use of that as well. Ever since ChatGPT came onto the scene, learning new skills has become so much simpler. By combining online tutorials with ChatGPT's guidance, I’ve explored a wide range of projects—building PCs, working with Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jekyll, GitHub Pages, Raspberry Pi, Cloudflare DNS, WireGuard VPN, Docker, Nginx, Proxmox Virtual Environment, TrueNAS, OpenWRT, Azure Cloud, and more.

I initially started this blog as a way to learn Jekyll and GitHub Pages, but it’s grown into a space where I document my learning journey and share what I’ve discovered. Below, you’ll find a list of [tools](/tags) or you can browse the [categories](/categories) I’ve been exploring.

You can find my contact details at the bottom of the sidebar, including links to my GitHub, DataCamp portfolio, Linkedin, and email, if you'd like to connect.
